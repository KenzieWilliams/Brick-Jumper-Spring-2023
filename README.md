This is an arcade style game created in python using the pygame library.

While this is a generally complete game, there is one known error in the velocity attribute when restarting a game after parsing. It's being worked on.
Aside from that, this game was made as part of a high school course and thus not extensively in edge cases, so beware the possibility of minor errors.

This is merely a demonstration of some of one of my earliest completed prohects.

All art is original.
