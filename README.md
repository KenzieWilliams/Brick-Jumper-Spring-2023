This is an arcade style game created in python using the pygame library.

Dev commands:
- 'P' gifts the player 50 coins
- 'O' resets the game

While this is a generally complete game, there is one known error in the velocity attribute when restarting a game after parsing. It's being worked on.
Aside from that, this game was made as part of a high school course and thus not extensively in edge cases, so beware the possibility of minor errors.

This is merely a demonstration of some of one of my earliest completed prohects.

All art is original.

Skills: Python, pygame, JSON saving & parsing data, creation & manipulation of actors, coin system, health system, player customization / switching actors
